> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is a _hard fork_ of [ichiban/prolog](https://github.com/ichiban/prolog), customized to meet the specific requirements of the [Axone protocol](https://github.com/axone-protocol). It is maintained independently for our use case, and upstream updates may not be regularly integrated.

> For the original, general-purpose Prolog implementation or to contribute to the broader community, please visit the [ichiban/prolog repository](https://github.com/ichiban/prolog).

## What is this?

`axone-protocol/prolog` is a Prolog virtual machine written in Go, designed to be embedded in blockchain environments.
It serves as the core of the [Axone protocol](https://axone.xyz) for decentralized, logic-based smart contracts.

This project is a fork of the [ichiban/prolog](https://github.com/ichiban/prolog) repository, striving to maintain
ISO standard compliance where feasible while adapting to the unique constraints of blockchain execution.

## Deviations from the ISO Standard

The following customizations have been made to adapt the original `ichiban/prolog` implementation to the blockchain environment:

- Capped variable allocation to limit the number of variables.
- Replaced maps with ordered maps to ensure deterministic execution.
- Implemented secure integer arithmetic for functors.
- Integrated [cockroachdb/apd](https://github.com/cockroachdb/apd) for floating-point arithmetic.
- Removed support for trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `asin`, `acos`, `atan`).
- Introduced VM hooks for enhanced Prolog execution control.
- Added support for the `Dict` term.
